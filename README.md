# SmartPetShop — Online Pet Store Management System

SmartPetShop is a web-based platform designed to help pet shops manage their daily operations efficiently. The system supports three user roles — **Admin**, **Employee**, and **Customer** — each with different permissions for managing pets, food, supplies, customers, and orders. The application ensures accurate inventory tracking, smooth order processing, and a simple user experience.

## 1. Problem Statement
Many small pet stores still use notebooks or basic spreadsheets to track stock, customers, and sales. This leads to:
- Inaccurate inventory  
- Slow order processing  
- Difficulty tracking low-stock items  
- Lack of customer records  
- No automated invoices or purchase history  

SmartPetShop solves these issues by offering a digital, centralized, and role-based platform.
