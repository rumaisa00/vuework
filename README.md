# VueWork - Team Tasks & Scheduling App

![CI Status](https://github.com/yourusername/vuework/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## 📋 Problem Statement

Small teams often struggle with fragmented task management across emails, spreadsheets, and sticky notes. Communication breaks down, deadlines are missed, and there's no clear visibility into project progress. VueWork solves this by providing a centralized, intuitive platform where teams can manage projects, assign tasks, track progress, and collaborate effectively in one place.

## 👥 Target Users

- **Small teams** (3-10 members) in startups or small businesses
- **Student project groups** working on collaborative assignments
- **Freelance teams** coordinating remote work
- **Department teams** in larger organizations needing lightweight project management

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Users can create a new project and add tasks in under 2 minutes
- Team members can move tasks across status columns with a single drag
- 90% of users can navigate the app without external help
- Page load time under 2 seconds on average connections
- Mobile-responsive design works seamlessly on phones and tablets
- Accessibility score of 90+ on Lighthouse audits
